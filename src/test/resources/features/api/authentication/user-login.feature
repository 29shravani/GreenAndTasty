  As a registered user
  I want to be able to sign in using my email and password
  So that I can access my account securely

#  @positive @smoke
#  Scenario Outline: Valid user logs in successfully with correct email and password
#    Given existing user trying to login
#    When I send a POST request to "/auth/sign-in" with username "<email>" and "<password>"
#    Then the response status code should be <status_code>
#
#    Examples:
#      | email                | password    | status_code |
#      | Harshitha_b@gmail.com | Harshitha@123 | 200         |

    When I send a POST request to "/auth/sign-in" with username "<email>" and "<password>"
    Then the response status code should be <status_code>
    And the response should contain a valid authentication token
    And the username of user should be "<username>"
    And the role of user should be "<role>"
    And the response should match the JSON schema "schemas/authentication/userlogin.json"
